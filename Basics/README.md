# Structure of a C program
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main ()

{
printf("Hello World");
return 0;
}
```
## What is #include <stdio.h> means ? 

It means like tell the compiler to add stdio.h library to the beginning of the code when it starts to compile. std.io, shortened standard input output is a C library.
